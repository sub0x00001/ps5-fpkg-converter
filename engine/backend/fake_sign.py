"""Recursive fake-signing for decrypted PS5 game dumps.

Walks a folder, finds every ``.bin`` / ``.elf`` / ``.prx`` / ``.sprx`` file and
replaces each genuine ELF in place with its fake-signed SELF/SPRX, using the
vendored :mod:`make_fself` (flatz / ps5-payload-dev, redistributed by
alex-free/ps5-make-fself-recursive). This is a Python re-implementation of that
project's ``ps5mfr`` bash wrapper, with three deliberate safety improvements:

* **ELF-magic guard** — only files that actually start with ``\\x7fELF`` are
  signed. Data ``.bin`` files (not executables) and files that are *already*
  fake-signed (they start with the SELF magic ``\\x4F\\x15\\x3D\\x1D``, not the
  ELF magic) are skipped. This makes the whole operation **idempotent**: running
  it twice over the same dump is safe and a no-op on the second pass.
* **Atomic in-place replace** — each file is signed to a temp file in the same
  directory and then ``os.replace``-d over the original, so an interrupted run
  (crash, kill, full disk) can never leave a half-written, corrupt executable.
* **No subprocess per file** — the signer is imported and called directly.

The original file's permission bits are preserved.
